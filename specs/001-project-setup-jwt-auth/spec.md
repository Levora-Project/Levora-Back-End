## 1. Feature Overview

### 1.1 Description

This feature establishes the foundational infrastructure for the Levora platform by updating the database schema to align with Levora Database Design v1.2 and implementing a complete JWT-based authentication system with access and refresh tokens. The feature ensures the system is ready for subsequent development sprints with a solid data model and secure authentication.

### 1.2 Goals

- Update Prisma schema to match Levora Database Design v1.2
- Implement JWT authentication with access and refresh tokens
- Enable user registration, login, token refresh, and profile retrieval
- Automatically create user profiles upon registration
- Set up comprehensive testing and documentation infrastructure

### 1.3 Out of Scope

- OAuth integration (covered in Feature 002)
- Email verification workflows
- Password reset functionality
- User profile editing (covered in later sprints)
- Python service integration

| AC-001-03 | The Roles table contains `user`, `content_admin`, and `system_admin` records. |
| AC-001-04 | All fields use correct data types and have appropriate indexes. |

### 5.2 Registration

|----|-----------|
| AC-001-05 | `POST /auth/register` creates a new user with provided email, password, firstName, and lastName. |
| AC-001-06 | A `UserProfiles` record is automatically created upon registration. |
| AC-001-07 | Password is stored as a bcrypt hash, not plaintext. |
| AC-001-08 | Registration with an existing email returns a 409 Conflict error. |

| ID | Criterion |
|----|-----------|
| AC-001-15 | `POST /auth/refresh` returns a new access token for a valid refresh token. |

| Database migration conflicts with existing data | High | Backup database before migration; test migration on staging first |
| Schema validation issues | Medium | Run `prisma validate` before migration; review generated SQL |
| Token security vulnerabilities | High | Use industry-standard JWT practices; implement token rotation; store secrets securely |
| Migration rollback complexity | Medium | Maintain migration history; test rollback procedure |
| Missing indexes causing performance issues | Medium | Review and implement all recommended indexes from Database Design |
